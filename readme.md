# tab generator
Quick and simple GUI to write, play and print bass tabs.

# why?
Good question.

Before starting this project, I asked myself:
1) Have I tried looking for something like this that already exists?
2) Do I have any experience in making something like this?
3) Do I have any idea of what I'm actually doing?

Given that the answer to all three questions is no, I decided to embark on this wonderful journey.
